## Assignment Description
[Project Outline Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/modules/assignments/project-outline)
### Overview
This project is an app for a mobile rage room, and as the company doesn't have a traditional
storefront to engage potential customers. The company needs a portal for customers to read about the services provided,
the ability to register and login to access the services, schedule and reserve a time, send comments, and pay for their 
services.
This project was created for a real world business that will tentatively open in Spring of 2023. The original 
plan was to open a brick and mortar location, however, location and start-up costs are prohibitive and the new business 
model of the room being mobile reduces the financial strain on the company. Having a web presence is key to the
operation and success of "All The Rage!".

Please don't steal my idea, it would hurt my feelings.

### Features
The app has login and registration pages, a testimonial section, a form for comments and questions. Future features
will include a calendar, and a commerce portal to pay for rendered services.
