# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
For this project I have procured a client who wishes to have a new website for her therapy practice.
She would like a better looking and more functional design that should include an online library of books
where her clients are redirected to Amazon for purchase. She would also like certain patient forms to be included for new 
clients. The site will include a page for "Meet the Staff" with photographs and short biographies. Her staff would like 
an online calendar to track their hours and appointments.  
### Features
A login/authenticate user feature for staff to access their schedules and adjust their times.
A calendar.
A contact page for clients to send messages to the therapy team.
A form(s) page with preliminary questionnaires, with answers kept in Cloud Firestore/Firebase. 

### Technologies
Vue 3
Sass
HTML
JavaScript
Cloud Firestore and Firebase
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to work through the syntax of Vue and Sass, as well as how to create a calendar (probably utilizing FullCalendar),
and most likely a cloud database for answers from the online questionnaire. This project is in infancy and these technologies and 
features may change without notice.
